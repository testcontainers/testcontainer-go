## About

TestContainers is popular in Java, but there are other languages as well. This
is the Go implementation.

The project is opensource and you can have a look at the code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go),

## GoDoc

Inline documentation and docs where the code live is crucial for us. Go has a
nice support for them and we use Examples as well. Check it out
[pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go?tab=doc).
